The Olympic Games, considered to be the world's foremost sports competition have more than 200 nations participating across the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.

Throughout this project, we will explore the Olympics dataset(scraped from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table), look at some interesting statistics, and then try to find out which country is the King of Olympic Games.

The dataset has details of 146 countries with the following 16 features

In this project, I have applied the following concepts :

Dataframe operations

Conditional statement and loops

List operations

Bar Plotting

Mathematical operations

First I have checked if the countries can win any medal in any particular season and found out that in the summer season.

Then list down the top 10 medal-winning countries in Summer, Winter, and both seasons and extracted the common countries And then plotted these countries for better visualization.

Then checked which countries won a Gold medal maximum number of times in summer, winter, and both seasons.

Checked the best-performing country using the weighted value and plotted a nice stacked bar graph showing the medal count for better visualization
